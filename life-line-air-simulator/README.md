### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
Make sure you have the following files ready in a folder on your local machine:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `app.js` (you'll need to create this file if it doesn't exist yet)

### Step 2: Create a New GitHub Repository
1. **Log in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Fill in the repository name (e.g., `life-line-air-simulator`).
   - Optionally, add a description (e.g., "Autonomous Medical Drone Simulator").
   - Choose the visibility (Public or Private).
   - Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (you'll add these later if needed).
   - Click on "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Files
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-line-air-simulator.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd life-line-air-simulator
   ```

3. **Copy Your Project Files**:
   Copy the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` files into the cloned repository folder.

4. **Add the Files to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add index.html style.css app.js
   ```

5. **Commit the Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add project files for Life-Line Air Simulator"
   ```

6. **Push the Changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Your Repository
1. Go back to your GitHub repository page.
2. Refresh the page to see your uploaded files.

### Optional: Create a README
You may want to create a `README.md` file to provide information about your project. You can do this directly on GitHub or create it locally and push it to the repository.

### Example README Content
```markdown
